Frontend
HTML5: Provides the basic structure for your web game. It’s essential for embedding the Three.js canvas and any additional UI elements like menus or a HUD.
CSS3: Handles styling to ensure your game aligns with its intended aesthetic (e.g., a Ghibli-inspired art style). Custom CSS will allow you to create visually appealing interfaces and overlays that complement the 3D graphics.
JavaScript: The core programming language for your game logic and interactivity. Since Three.js is a JavaScript library, it integrates seamlessly, enabling you to manage 3D rendering, player movement, and game mechanics efficiently.
3D Graphics
Three.js: As your chosen library, Three.js handles all 3D rendering in the browser. It’s lightweight, powerful, and flexible enough to support your open-world first-person postal delivery game, including features like rollerblades and other transportation methods. It also supports asset loading (e.g., GLTF models) and basic interactions without requiring additional complexity.
Build Tool
Parcel: A simple, zero-configuration build tool that bundles your JavaScript, CSS, and assets into a production-ready package. It offers hot reloading during development, making it easy to test changes in real-time, and optimizes your code for deployment with minimal setup. This keeps the development process fast and uncluttered compared to more complex tools like Webpack.
Version Control
Git: Essential for tracking changes and collaborating (if you’re working with a team). Pairing Git with a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket ensures your codebase is safely stored and versioned, providing a robust foundation for development.
Hosting
Netlify or Vercel: Both are excellent static hosting platforms that offer easy deployment directly from a Git repository. They provide HTTPS out of the box, ensuring security, and have generous free tiers suitable for a simple game. They’re ideal for a client-side Three.js game, delivering fast load times and global CDN support to enhance the player experience.
Assets
GLTF Models: For your 3D assets (e.g., characters, environments, and transportation methods), use the GLTF format, which is well-supported by Three.js. You can create these models in tools like Blender, aligning with your Ghibli-inspired art style, and load them efficiently into the game.
Audio Files: Add background music and sound effects (e.g., for deliveries or movement) using compressed formats like MP3 or OGG. Three.js integrates with the Web Audio API, making it easy to trigger sounds based on game events.
Why This Stack?
This combination is simple because it avoids unnecessary frameworks or server-side complexity, keeping your focus on building the game itself. It’s robust because:

Three.js provides powerful 3D capabilities without low-level programming.
Parcel streamlines development and deployment workflows.
Git ensures your project is manageable and recoverable.
Netlify/Vercel offers reliable, scalable hosting with minimal maintenance.
Additional Notes
No Backend Initially: For a single-player game focused on viral features like a photo mode (implemented client-side with Three.js canvas snapshots), you don’t need a backend. Progress can be saved locally using localStorage. If you later add online features (e.g., leaderboards), you can extend the stack with Node.js and a service like Firebase.
Scalability: If your game grows (e.g., larger worlds or more complex interactions), this stack can adapt. For example, you could add a physics engine like Cannon.js or switch to a frontend framework like React with react-three-fiber for better organization—though these aren’t necessary for the initial version.
Development Tools: Use Visual Studio Code as your editor for its excellent JavaScript support and extensions (e.g., for Git and Three.js autocompletion).
This tech stack—HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with Three.js, Parcel, Git, and Netlify or Vercel, alongside GLTF models and audio files—gives you everything you need to build and launch your simple yet fun, viral-worthy game efficiently and effectively.
