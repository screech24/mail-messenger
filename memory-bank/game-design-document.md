2. Game Concept
2.1 Setting
The game takes place in a fictional, enchanting town inspired by the vibrant and magical worlds of Studio Ghibli films. Key features include:

Colorful buildings with a hand-painted aesthetic
Lush landscapes featuring forests, rivers, and rolling hills

2.2 Story
Players assume the role of a newly hired mail messenger in the town. Their journey begins with simple mail deliveries, but as they explore, they uncover the town’s mysteries and assist its residents through various tasks. The narrative unfolds organically through deliveries and interactions, revealing the town’s charm and secrets.

2.3 Objective
The primary goal is to deliver mail packages to the town’s residents while exploring the open world. Players must navigate challenges such as time-sensitive or fragile deliveries and adapt to environmental conditions, unlocking new transportation methods and areas as they progress.

3. Gameplay Mechanics
3.1 Core Mechanic: Mail Delivery
Players pick up mail packages from a central post office.
Each package has a recipient’s address and may include special instructions (e.g., "deliver within 5 minutes" or "handle with care").
Players must locate and deliver packages to the correct destinations in the town.
3.2 Navigation
A map or navigation aid is available to help players find delivery locations.
The town is a seamless open world divided into districts (e.g., urban areas, rural paths, elevated zones), each suited to different transportation methods.
3.3 Transportation
Players begin with basic transportation and unlock more advanced options over time:

Rollerblades: Quick and nimble, perfect for city streets but less effective in rain.
Bikes: Faster travel for longer distances and rural areas.
Scooters: Similar to bikes with unique handling traits.
Flying Machines: Enable access to elevated or hard-to-reach areas like floating islands.
Magical Transportation: Includes whimsical options like broomstick flying or enchanted creatures, reflecting the Ghibli-inspired theme.
Each method is tailored to specific terrains or delivery challenges, adding strategic depth.

3.4 Challenges
Environmental Factors:
Day-Night Cycles: Night deliveries require lights or enhanced visibility.
Weather: Rain makes surfaces slippery, snow slows movement, etc.
Special Delivery Conditions:
Time-sensitive packages demand quick action.
Fragile items require careful navigation to avoid damage.
3.5 NPC Interactions and Side Quests
Townspeople (NPCs) offer side quests, such as retrieving lost items or delivering urgent messages.
Completing these tasks rewards players with points, currency, or unique items, enhancing the exploration aspect.
4. Player Progression System
4.1 Experience Points and Levels
Players earn experience points (XP) by completing deliveries and side quests.
Leveling up unlocks:
New transportation methods (e.g., scooters, flying machines).
Access to additional town districts.
Enhanced abilities (e.g., faster delivery speed, improved handling).
4.2 Customization
Players use in-game currency (earned from deliveries and quests) to customize:
Character: Outfits, accessories, and appearance options.
Transportation: Skins, upgrades, or decorative elements (e.g., a floral bike design).
Customization adds a personal touch and encourages continued play.

Custom Color Palettes: Tailored to evoke the Ghibli aesthetic.
Textures: Stylized, hand-painted designs for buildings, landscapes, and characters.
5.3 Implementation in three.js
Custom shaders in three.js will achieve the cel-shaded look.
Optimized 3D models and textures ensure compatibility with web browsers.
6. Technical Implementation
6.1 Engine
Built using three.js, a JavaScript library for 3D graphics, enabling a web-based experience.
6.2 3D Rendering
The town is constructed with lightweight 3D models optimized for browser performance.
Level of detail (LOD) techniques adjust rendering based on distance to maintain smooth gameplay.
6.3 Player Movement
First-person controls for walking, running, and operating transportation.
Collision detection ensures realistic interactions with the environment.
6.4 Inventory System
A simple inventory UI tracks mail packages, displaying addresses, conditions, and a map.

Sound Effects: Package pickups, transportation sounds, and environmental noises (e.g., birds chirping).
Background Music: Ghibli-inspired tracks to enhance immersion.
6.6 Performance Optimization
Low-poly models, texture atlasing, and efficient rendering techniques ensure smooth performance across devices.
7. Viral Features and Shareability
7.1 Photo Mode
Players can pause gameplay to enter photo mode, capturing screenshots of the picturesque world.
Images can be saved and shared directly from the browser using three.js’s canvas output.
7.2 Leaderboards
Competitive rankings for:
