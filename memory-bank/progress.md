# Mail Messenger Development Progress

## March 19, 2025

### Step 1: Project Setup Complete
- Created a new React app with PWA template using Create React App
- Configured directory structure:
  - src/components (for React components)
  - src/hooks (for custom React hooks)
  - src/contexts (for React context providers)
  - src/utils (for utility functions)
  - src/assets (for audio files and icons)
  - src/game (for game-specific logic)
- Initialized Git repository
- Set up GitHub remote repository: https://github.com/screech24/mail-messenger.git
- Committed and pushed initial project structure

### Step 2: Build Tools and Dependencies Configuration Complete
- Installed Three.js for 3D rendering
- Installed Cannon.js for physics simulation
- Installed Zustand for state management
- Installed Supabase for backend storage
- Verified that the application runs with the new dependencies

### Step 3: Basic React Component Structure Complete
- Created GameCanvas.js component for Three.js canvas
- Created UI.js component for game interface elements
- Updated App.js to include both components
- Implemented basic CSS styling
- Verified that the application runs with the new components

### Step 4: Game State Management with Zustand Complete
- Created src/game/gameStore.js to manage game state using Zustand
- Implemented core state slices:
  - playerState (position, rotation, current transportation, has mail)
  - worldState (time of day, weather, active quests, score)
  - settingsState (sound volume, music volume, graphics quality, controls)
- Created actions for updating each part of the state
- Updated UI component to display state information
- Updated App.js to test state management
- Verified state management works correctly

### Step 5: Initialize Three.js Scene in React Complete
- Set up a Three.js scene in GameCanvas.js using useEffect
- Created a perspective camera with 75-degree FOV
- Initialized a WebGL renderer targeting a canvas ref
- Set up a basic animation loop using requestAnimationFrame
- Implemented a resize handler for responsive canvas
- Added basic lighting (ambient + directional)
- Added a simple ground plane for visual reference
- Verified the scene renders correctly in the browser

### Step 6: Implement Asset Loading Manager Complete
- Created src/game/assetManager.js to handle asset loading
- Implemented a Three.js LoadingManager to track loading progress
- Created functions to generate procedural assets using Three.js:
  - createPlayerModel() for generating a simple character
  - createBuildingModel(type) for generating different building types
  - createTerrainModel() for generating terrain
- Updated gameStore.js with loading state management
- Created LoadingScreen component to display loading progress
- Updated GameCanvas to use the asset manager and display procedural assets
- Updated App.js to initialize and simulate the loading process
- Verified assets load with progress indicator before game starts

### Step 7: Implement Physics with Cannon.js Complete
- Created src/game/physics.js to manage Cannon.js integration
- Set up a physics world with gravity
- Implemented physics materials and contact materials for different interactions
- Created physics bodies for:
  - Player character (using a cylinder shape)
  - Ground/terrain (using a plane)
  - Buildings and obstacles (using boxes with different dimensions)
- Implemented physics step function to update the world
- Created InputHandler component to process keyboard inputs
- Added player movement with physics forces
- Updated gameStore with input state management
- Updated UI to display physics-related information
- Synced Three.js objects with Cannon.js bodies in the animation loop
- Implemented collision detection and handling
- Verified physics calculations are applied to objects

### Next Steps
- Step 8: Build Procedural Environment
  - Generate ground plane with texture
  - Place buildings in a grid pattern using noise algorithms
  - Add decorative elements (trees, benches, lampposts)
  - Apply cel shaders for Ghibli-inspired style
  - Implement culling system for performance
