# Mail Messenger Development Progress

## March 19, 2025

### Step 1: Project Setup Complete
- Created a new React app with PWA template using Create React App
- Configured directory structure:
  - src/components (for React components)
  - src/hooks (for custom React hooks)
  - src/contexts (for React context providers)
  - src/utils (for utility functions)
  - src/assets (for audio files and icons)
  - src/game (for game-specific logic)
- Initialized Git repository
- Set up GitHub remote repository: https://github.com/screech24/mail-messenger.git
- Committed and pushed initial project structure

### Step 2: Build Tools and Dependencies Configuration Complete
- Installed Three.js for 3D rendering
- Installed Cannon.js for physics simulation
- Installed Zustand for state management
- Installed Supabase for backend storage
- Verified that the application runs with the new dependencies

### Step 3: Basic React Component Structure Complete
- Created GameCanvas.js component for Three.js canvas
- Created UI.js component for game interface elements
- Updated App.js to include both components
- Implemented basic CSS styling
- Verified that the application runs with the new components

### Step 4: Game State Management with Zustand Complete
- Created src/game/gameStore.js to manage game state using Zustand
- Implemented core state slices:
  - playerState (position, rotation, current transportation, has mail)
  - worldState (time of day, weather, active quests, score)
  - settingsState (sound volume, music volume, graphics quality, controls)
- Created actions for updating each part of the state
- Updated UI component to display state information
- Updated App.js to test state management
- Verified state management works correctly

### Step 5: Initialize Three.js Scene in React Complete
- Set up a Three.js scene in GameCanvas.js using useEffect
- Created a perspective camera with 75-degree FOV
- Initialized a WebGL renderer targeting a canvas ref
- Set up a basic animation loop using requestAnimationFrame
- Implemented a resize handler for responsive canvas
- Added basic lighting (ambient + directional)
- Added a simple ground plane for visual reference
- Verified the scene renders correctly in the browser

### Next Steps
- Step 6: Implement Asset Loading Manager
  - Create src/game/assetManager.js to handle asset loading
  - Implement a Three.js LoadingManager to track loading progress
  - Create functions to generate procedural assets using Three.js
  - Add loading progress UI component
