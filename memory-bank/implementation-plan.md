# Implementation Plan for "Mail Messenger" Base Game

## Project Setup & Organization

### Step 1: Set Up React Project Structure
- Create a new React app using Create React App with PWA template: `npx create-react-app mail-messenger --template cra-template-pwa`
- Inside the project, create subdirectories:
  - `src/components` for React components
  - `src/hooks` for custom React hooks
  - `src/contexts` for React context providers
  - `src/utils` for utility functions
  - `src/assets` for audio files and icons
  - `src/game` for game-specific logic
- Initialize a Git repository if not already done: `git init`
- Test: Run `git status` to verify repository initialization.

### Step 2: Configure Build Tools and Dependencies
- Install Three.js: `npm install three`
- Install Cannon.js for physics: `npm install cannon-es`
- Install Zustand for state management: `npm install zustand`
- Install Supabase for backend storage: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`
- Add the following scripts to package.json:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
  ```
- Test: Run `npm start` to verify the development server starts and opens in a browser.

### Step 3: Create Basic React Component Structure
- Create a `GameCanvas.js` component in `src/components` that will contain the Three.js canvas
- Create a `UI.js` component for game interface elements
- Create an `App.js` that includes both components
- Set up basic CSS in `index.css` and component-specific styles
- Test: Run `npm start` and verify the basic React app structure loads without errors.

## Core Game Engine Setup

### Step 4: Set Up Game State Management with Zustand
- Create `src/game/gameStore.js` to manage game state using Zustand
- Implement core state slices:
  - `playerState` (position, rotation, current transportation, has mail)
  - `worldState` (time of day, weather, active quests)
  - `settingsState` (sound volume, graphics quality)
- Create actions for updating state
- Test: Import store in App.js and log state to verify it's working.

### Step 5: Initialize Three.js Scene in React
- In GameCanvas.js, set up a Three.js scene using useEffect
- Create a perspective camera with 75-degree FOV
- Initialize a WebGL renderer targeting a canvas ref
- Set up a basic animation loop using requestAnimationFrame
- Implement a resize handler for responsive canvas
- Add basic lighting (ambient + directional)
- Test: Verify canvas renders and resizes with the window.

### Step 6: Implement Asset Loading Manager
- Create `src/game/assetManager.js` to handle asset loading
- Implement a Three.js LoadingManager to track loading progress
- Create functions to generate procedural assets using Three.js:
  - `createPlayerModel()`: Generate simple character using Three.js geometries
  - `createBuildingModel(type)`: Generate different building types using Three.js geometries
  - `createTerrainModel()`: Generate terrain using Three.js plane and noise algorithms
- Add loading progress UI component
- Test: Verify assets load with progress indicator before game starts.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Step 7: Implement Physics with Cannon.js
- Create `src/game/physics.js` to manage Cannon.js integration
- Set up a physics world with gravity
- Create physics bodies for:
  - Player character
  - Ground/terrain
  - Buildings and obstacles
- Implement a physics step function to update the world
- Sync Three.js objects with Cannon.js bodies in the animation loop
- Test: Verify physics calculations are applied to objects.

### Step 8: Build Procedural Environment
- Create functions to generate the game world procedurally:
  - Generate ground plane with texture
  - Place buildings in a grid pattern using noise algorithms for variety
  - Add decorative elements (trees, benches, lampposts) using simple Three.js geometries
- Apply cel shaders to all objects to achieve Ghibli-inspired style
- Implement a simple culling system to only render nearby objects
- Test: Verify environment generates with varied buildings and decorations.

### Step 9: Implement Transportation System
- Create a base class for all transportation methods
- Implement rollerblade movement first:
  - Add momentum and friction physics
  - Different surface types affect movement (using Cannon.js materials)
- Prepare for future transportation methods:
  - Bikes: Higher top speed, less maneuverability
  - Scooters: Balanced speed and maneuverability
  - Flying machines: Vertical movement capabilities
- Test: Move around the environment with realistic momentum and friction.

### Step 10: Add Collision Detection and Response
- Use Cannon.js collision detection
- Implement collision callbacks for different interaction types:
  - Building collisions stop movement
  - Mail pickup/delivery zone triggers interactions
  - NPC interaction zones
- Add visual feedback for collisions (subtle camera shake)
- Test: Verify player stops at buildings and can interact with objects.

## Game Features

### Step 11: Implement Mail Delivery System
- Create mail objects using Three.js geometries (envelopes, packages)
- Add a post office location where mail can be picked up
- Implement delivery locations throughout the map
- Create a task system for mail delivery with:
  - Pickup mechanics (press 'E' near mail)
  - Carrying state (mail visible on player)
  - Delivery mechanics (press 'E' at correct location)
- Test: Complete full mail delivery cycle multiple times.

### Step 12: Add Day-Night Cycle and Weather System
- Implement a day-night cycle:
  - Create a sky dome with changing colors
  - Add sun and moon objects that move across the sky
  - Adjust lighting based on time of day
- Implement weather system:
  - Clear, rainy, and snowy conditions
  - Visual effects (particle systems for rain/snow)
  - Physics effects (reduced friction during rain/snow)
  - Lighting changes based on weather
- Test: Verify day-night transitions and weather changes affect gameplay.

### Step 13: Create Photo Mode Feature
- Implement photo mode when player presses 'P':
  - Pause game physics
  - Allow camera to be freely positioned (detached from player)
  - Add filters and effects options (sepia, vignette, etc.)
  - Implement screenshot capture using canvas.toDataURL()
  - Add UI for sharing to social media
- Test: Take screenshots in different locations and verify file saving.

### Step 14: Implement Save/Load System with Supabase
- Set up Supabase project and configure API
- Create data models for:
  - Player progress (completed deliveries, unlocked areas)
  - Player customizations
  - High scores
- Implement local saving using localStorage as fallback
- Add login/signup for online features
- Create auto-save functionality
- Test: Verify game state saves and loads correctly.

## Performance and Polish

### Step 15: Optimize Performance
- Implement level of detail (LOD) for distant objects
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Add frustum culling to only render visible objects
- Implement occlusion culling for densely built areas
- Optimize shaders for performance
- Test on various devices and optimize for target frame rate (60 FPS)
- Test: Monitor FPS and memory usage during gameplay.

### Step 16: Add Sound and Music
- Integrate sound effects for:
  - Movement (rollerblades on different surfaces)
  - Weather (rain, wind)
  - Interactions (mail pickup/delivery)
- Add ambient background music that changes with:
  - Time of day
  - Weather
  - Location in game world
- Implement audio manager with volume controls
- Test: Verify all sound effects and music play correctly.

### Step 17: Polish and Debug
- Test the full mail delivery cycle multiple times
- Check that transportation feels responsive with appropriate physics
- Ensure collision detection works consistently
- Verify UI updates correctly
- Test day-night cycle and weather effects
- Optimize for performance and fix any frame rate issues
- Test save/load functionality
- Test photo mode
- Implement error handling and recovery
- Test: Play through multiple delivery cycles under various conditions.

## Deployment

### Step 18: PWA Configuration and Deployment
- Configure service worker for offline capabilities
- Set up app manifest for installable PWA
- Optimize assets for web delivery
- Test PWA installation and offline functionality
- Deploy to hosting service (Netlify or Vercel)
- Test: Verify the game works as a PWA and can be installed on devices.

## Notes
- All assets will be created programmatically using Three.js geometries without external 3D models
- Only external assets will be sound files and icons, which will be sourced separately
- Code organization follows React component structure with hooks and contexts
- State management uses Zustand for simplicity and performance
- Physics implementation uses Cannon.js for realistic movement and collisions
- Tests are manual verification steps to be performed during development
- The implementation supports progressive enhancement with more complex features added after core functionality
